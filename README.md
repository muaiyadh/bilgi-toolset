# Bilgi Toolset

Tools to enhance the experience for Bilgi University's website

The userscripts require Tampermonkey or a similar extension to run.

***

### 1. Bilgi Learn: display as List

Displays courses as a List instead of the weird default Cards format.


### 2. Zoom Recordings scraper

Adds a button on the Zoom Recordings page to directly download info of all recordings of this course as a csv file.
The info include: Recording link, recording password, meeting topic, total duration, recording start time, recording size.

NOTE: this tool should work fine, but due to the way it works, try avoid using abusing it _too_ much.

### 3. Exam schedule search

A Python script that takes the Excel file for exams dates and the courses names as input, and gives each course's exam date and time as output.

### 4. Zoom Recordings chat sync fix and autoscroll

Lets you manually fix the sync between the Zoom recording and the chat messages.
Also, automatically scrolls to the current chat message.
